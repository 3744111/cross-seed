# cross-seed

`cross-seed` is an app designed to help you download torrents that you can cross
seed based on your existing torrents. It will only find torrents whose file
contents exactly match the file contents of the input torrents. This means that
`.nfo` files have a high likelihood of causing a rejection.

`cross-seed` will download a bunch of torrent files to a folder you specify.
After that, I recommend using
[AutoTorrent](https://github.com/JohnDoee/autotorrent) to do the last-mile
delivery into your client.

## Requirements

-   [Node 10+](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
-   [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett)

It will work on Mac and on Linux; I haven't tested it on Windows but it probably
works there too.

## Usage

Invoking it is _almost_ as simple as:

```shell script
npx cross-seed
```

Here's an example invocation:

```shell script
npx cross-seed search -u http://localhost:9117/jackett -k JACKETT_API_KEY -d 10 -t all -i /home/rtorrent/.session -s /tmp/torrents
```

You either need to give it a lot of command-line arguments or create a
[configuration file](#configuration).

  -d, --delay <delay>             Pause duration (seconds) between searches

  -t, --trackers <tracker>        Comma-separated list of Jackett tracker ids
                                  to search
  -i, --torrent-dir <dir>         Directory with torrent files
  -s, --output-dir <dir>          Directory to save results in
  -o, --offset <offset>           Offset to start from (default: 0)
  -h, --help                      display help for command

```

## Install

You don't need to install this app, but if you really want to, or if your
version of `npm` doesn't support `npx`, you can install it globally:

```shell script
npm install -g cross-seed
```

Then you can run the app with:

```shell script
cross-seed
```

To update,

```shell script
npm update -g cross-seed
```

## Configuration

`cross-seed` will look for a configuration file at `~/.cross-seed/config.js`
(`AppData\Local\cross-seed\config.js` on Windows). In the configuration file ,
you can specify all of the same flags you specified on the command line, but
after that, you won't have to specify them on the command line any more.

To create a configuration file, run

```shell script
cross-seed gen-config
```

Then you can edit the file using your editor of choice.
